# shaver

<i>Hackathon project for Calhacks 1.0, Fall 2014</i>

This is a web-based application for validating large files.  It takes the SHA-1 hash of the upload and compares it with the hash of 
other uploads under the same name.  More info available on request.

This project is incomplete and not under development.  I just uploaded it for archival purposes.
